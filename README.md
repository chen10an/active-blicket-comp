# Active Blicket Composition Experiment

## The main branch contains only this README. The code for implementing this experiment (as a Svelte web app) is found in the other branches.
Each branch corresponds to a different experiment version.

## Analyses
Participant behavior in this experiment is analyzed (statistics and Bayesian modeling) in [a separate repository](https://github.com/chen10an/active-blicket-comp-analysis).
