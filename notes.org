* Notes
** Current versions:
- for release :: 2.0.0-mturk-micro
- for somata :: 2.0.x-mturk-micro
** Things to update when making a new version of the experiment
- ~package.json~ version
- ~package-lock.json~ version (top level active-blicket-comp version only)
- ~App.svelte~ experiment_id prop for each route
  - which takes care of experiment_id for sending messages to somata in ~ExperimentController.svelte~
- also make sure a somata config exists for this version
** Install from ~package-lock.json~ via ~npm ci~
Not ~npm install~, which updates all packages and may break reproducibility.
** Use ~npm run <script_name>~ to do stuff
The different scripts are defined in ~package.json~.
