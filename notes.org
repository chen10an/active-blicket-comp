* Notes
** Install from ~package-lock.json~ via ~npm ci~
Not ~npm install~, which updates all packages and may break reproducibility.
** Use ~npm run <script_name>~ to do stuff
The different scripts are defined in ~package.json~.
** Things to update when making a new version of the experiment
- ~package.json~ version
- ~package-lock.json~ version (top level active-blicket-comp version only)
- ~App.svelte~ experiment_id prop for each route
- ~ExperimentController.svelte~: experiment_id for sending messages to somata
  - also make sure a somata config exists for this version
