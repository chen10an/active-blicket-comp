# Active Blicket Composition Experiment

## The main branch only contains this README. The code for implementing this experiment (as a web app) is found in the other branches.
Each branch corresponds to a different experiment version.

## Analyses
Participant behavior in the experiment is analyzed (statistics and Bayesian modeling) in [a separate repository](https://github.com/chen10an/active-blicket-comp-analysis).

## Web Framework
This experiment's web application is implemented with the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) framework and was started from [this template](https://github.com/sveltejs/template). The entry-point to the app is in `/src/main.js`, which imports and renders `/src/App.svelte`.
