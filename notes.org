* Notes
** Managing versions
New branch (named <MAJOR>.x.x) --> increment major version
New somata config (named <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.x) --> increment minor version
Meaningful updates that share a somata config (named <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>) --> increment patch version

** Install from ~package-lock.json~ via ~npm ci~
Not ~npm install~, which updates all packages and may break reproducibility.
** Use ~npm run <script_name>~ to do stuff
The different scripts are defined in ~package.json~.
** Things to update when making a new version of the experiment
- ~package.json~ version
- ~package-lock.json~ version (top level active-blicket-comp version only)
- ~App.svelte~ experiment_id prop for each route
  - which takes care of experiment_id for sending messages to somata in ~ExperimentController.svelte~
- also make sure a somata config exists for this version
